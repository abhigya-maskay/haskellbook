* Cardinality
** 1)
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
data PugType = PugData
#+END_SRC
This has a cardinality of 1 because it has only one constant value represented by the data constructor (~PugData~)
** 2)
This has a cardinality of 3 because there are three data constructors each of which is a constant value
** 3)
The cardinality of Int16 is 65536 (32768 + 1 + 32767)
** 4)
The cardinality of Integer is not bounded so it is infinite. The cardinality of Int is (9223372036854775807 + 1 + 9223372036854775808)
** 5)
The 8 in Int 8 is the number of bits used to store the value of the integer. So the cardinality is ~2 ^ 8~
