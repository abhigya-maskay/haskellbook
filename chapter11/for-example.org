* For example
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :tangle for-example.hs :comments link
data Example = MakeExample deriving Show
#+END_SRC
** 1)
The type of ~MakeExample~ is ~Example~. Requesting the type of ~Example~ gives us an error because ~Example~ is not a data constructor, it is a type constructor. So ~Example~ does not have a type (as is not a value or a term level/runtime construct)
** 2)
~:info~ does show information for ~Example~ and the way that it is defined. It also shows that ~Show~ is the only typeclass instance currently defined for our Example type.
** 3)
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell :tangle for-example.hs :comments link
data Example2 = MakeExample2 Int deriving Show
#+END_SRC
Querying for ~MakeExample2~ in GHCi now shows that it has a type of ~Int -> Example2~ and so it does not have a concrete type. It needs to be applied to an argument of type ~Int~ to give us something of type ~Example2~
